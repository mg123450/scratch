The goal of this project is to allow the user to organize a kitchen pantry through tracking of ingredients. Below are the features that are to be included:
-Track ingredients: allows the user to add and remove recipes from their pantry 
-Suggest recipes: a set of recipes will be stored in the program along with their needed ingredients and quantities. The program will suggest recipes based on the ingredients available in the pantry.
